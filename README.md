Middleware - Redux Saga \
Component - React hooks and higher order components \
EcmaScript - ES6.\

**Note: FYI, React-map-gl expects the valid access token and it is not working properly without valid token, so i have applied mapbox-gl and If get the token from Mapbox account, the account requests the billing information. So, I am used the token from public dataset from OpenStreetMap (OSM).The marker is not pinned the location properly due to public token.Kindly note it.**
